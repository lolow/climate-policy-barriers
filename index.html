          <h2>Welcome the Atlas of Climate Policy Barriers</h2>
          <p>
                This atlas presents the barriers and the challenges of climate policies
                which have been identified in the
                <a href="https://www.cd-links.org/" target="_blank">CD-LINKS</a> project.
          </p>
          <p>
                This tool aims at communicating, to both lay and non-technical audiences,
                the major implementation challenges, hot spots and criticalities
                for guiding climate and sustainable development-related policy making.
                This tools has been tested and discussed with multiple stakeholders
                during its development.

          <h1 id="indicators">Indicators of climate policy barriers</h1>

          <p>
            Many
            indicators have been considered during the process of conceptualizing
            and developing the Atlas. These indicators have been identified by
            the different stakeholders through multiple discussions entertained
            during the course of the project (more on the protocol in later
            sections). We selected a short list of 6 indicators that cover all
            key elements and at the same time allow us to keep the tool tractable
            and readable for users.

            <h2><img src="img/coal.png" height="30px"> Future coal power plants</h2>

            <p>The
            number of future coal power plants (including those under
            construction and planned capacity) is an indicator of potential
            stranded assets. The presence of committed emissions has been long
            recognized as a key impediment to the enactment of stringent climate
            policy (Davis &amp; Socolow, 2014). Stranded assets are defined as
            &quot;those investments which are made but which, at some time prior
            to the end of their economic life (as assumed at the investment
            decision point), are no longer able to earn an economic return, as a
            result of changes in the market and regulatory environment.&quot;
            according to the definition by IEA World Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA,
            2019). Coal power plants are the most problematic asset as they
            represent huge investments with large commitments in terms of
            resource exploitation, energy jobs and low energy price. For
            visibility and performance, only countries with more than 150 MW of
            future capacities are kept</p>

            <p>Fossil
            fuel subsidies are increasing fossil fuel consumption, leading to
            higher global carbon emissions and, as a consequence raise the
            required level of climate change mitigation (Jewel et al., 2018) and
            represent a critical measure of the political strength of the fossil
            fuel sector in a given region (IISD, 2009). Moreover, the removal of
            fossil fuel subsidies would be beneficial in many aspects (reducing
            budget deficit, increasing economic growth) that would improve the
            feasibility of the implementation of climate policies (Hayer, 2017)</p>

                Low-carbon investments required for a well-below 2C world</h2>

            <p>The
            magnitude of low carbon investments is an indicator of how strong the
            commitments of the countries to reduce their carbon footprint in the
            energy supply sector should be. As mobilizing large sums of money can
            be challenging, this indicator represents a measure of the potential
            barriers within the financial domain. G20 countries have
            ‘reemphasized’ the previously agreed commitment of wealthy
            countries to jointly mobilize 100 billion dollars per year (during
            the period 2020-2025) for mitigation actions in developing countries.
            Considerably more capital would have to be mobilized in order to
            close the investment gap for a 2° C- or 1.5° C-consistent future
            (McCollum et al., 2018). High values of the indicator highlight
            regions where required investments are highest</p>

            emissions represent the carbon intensity in traded goods and they

            production based measures of emissions. The higher the dependence of
            a country on goods that are produced with large amount on emissions
            and then imported, the higher would be the implications on trade of
            climate change policies, indicating a potential impediment to their

            Restriction is the opposite of the “Economic freedom indicator”
            which is calculated by the Heritage Foundation. The latter is a

            between civil freedoms (including business freedom) and a clean
            environment (Bernauer &amp; Koubi, 2009). Additionally, Etsy and
            Porter (2005) found a positive correlation between competitiveness
            and environmental performance. In the Atlas, we report the indicator
            of Economic Restriction only countries for countries with a value of

                School non-attendance</h2>

            <p>School
            non-attendance is a key indicator of education. Education is a
            determinant of good governance and good governance, in turn,
            increases environmental performance (Epstein, 2006; Inglehart &amp;
            Welzel, 2009). Education equality is also an indicator of governance
            performance (Andrijevic,2020). Finally, education is highly
            correlated to the propensity to support climate change policies.  It
            has been found that globally education level tends to be the single
            strongest predictor of public awareness of climate change (Lee <i>et
            al.</i>, 2015)</p>
            <p>Although
            many indicators of education exist, we have chosen one of the most
            widely adopted, i.e. the school enrolment of girls at secondary

        <p>The
          following subsections provide a quick overview of the functionalities
          of the Atlas. The Atlas can be browsed using any modern browser that
          can understand JavaScript, but in order to enjoy all the features of
          the interface, we recommend the use of google chrome, or equivalent.
          The map is working with Firefox but some visual features are not
          available on this platform.</p>

         <h2> Main page</h2>
  
          <p>The
          main page is composed of different parts:

          <p></p><ul>
            <li>The
            main header: Click on it to reinitialize the map.
            <li>The
            menu: User can choose the navigation mode (explore or combine) and
            she/he can also decide to share the Atlas on social media.</li>
            <li>Indicators
            on the left and right side: These are represented by bubbles which
            can be activated by hovering or clicking on them. The indicators are
            identified by an icon and an explanatory tag appears when the
            indicator is in the focus or selected.</li>
            <li>The
            map: The shape of the regions can change according to the spatial
            resolution of the indicator.</li>
            <li>The
            footer: It contains information about the interface, how to use the
            interface and about the CD-LINKS project.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <h2>
              Mode <i>exploration</i></h2>
          
              <p>The
          exploration mode is activated from the beginning or when the user
          clicks on the menu item ‘Explore’. The following actions are
          possible:</p>
          
        <p><ul>
            <li>Fast
            exploration: The user can quickly activate the indicators by
            hovering the mouse on the indicator icons. The bubbles will move
            from their starting point to their position on the map.</li>
            <li>Selection
            of an indicator: The user can lock an indicator by clicking on the
            indicator icon. She/he can get more information about the value
            using the mouse and pointing it to the bubbles on the map.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p><b>About
          the bubbles: </b>The bubble size is
          proportional to the value of the indicator for the given country or
          region. Values are normalized so that they are comparable across
          indicators. When an indicator is selected, a scaling legend is
          displayed at the bottom of the map along with the reference of the
          data source. Each indicator has a unique color. On the map, the
          bubbles are located at the centroid of the given region. More
          information can be seen if the user hovers the bubbles.</p>
          
          
          <h2>
              Mode <i>Combination</i></h2>

          <p>The
          user activates the mode Combination by clicking on the menu item
          ‘Combine’. In this mode, the user can select more than one
          indicator to be displayed on the map. The bubbles will
          aggregate while keeping their colour to highlight hotspot on the map
          for all the selected indicators. 
          </p>
 
          <p>We
          recommend not to use more than 3 indicators at the same time as it
          becomes difficult to interpret the indicators’ combination (however
          combining more than 3 indicators is possible in the interface). The
          size of the bubbles is automatically adjusted when the number of
          selected indicators is increasing.</p>
